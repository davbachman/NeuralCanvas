# Datasets

[Guide home](../README.md) · [Get started](USAGE.md) · [Blocks](BLOCKS.md) · [Training](TRAINING.md)

Add a **Dataset** block and choose its **Source** on the block or in **Details**. The block's output handles are labeled with feature and target names. Connect features into the model through **Input** blocks or directly to operations. Connect the desired target to a **Target** block, then to the second input of **Loss**; a direct dataset-to-loss target connection also works.

Selecting a dataset shows its **Train / test split**, **Examples**, and, where applicable, **Output mode** in Details. The **Data** tab lets you browse all dataset rows, see which split each row belongs to, and inspect the values currently flowing from each output column. **One example** is useful for tracing a calculation. **Numeric batch** sends an entire numeric split through the graph. Image and token-sequence sources provide complete tensor examples one at a time. Changing the selected example changes what you inspect on the canvas; multi-epoch training still uses the training split, and **Test → Run inference** evaluates the selected test or training split without updating weights.

## Included sources

| Family | Sources and use |
| --- | --- |
| Regression | Line and cubic functions in one dimension; a plane in two dimensions. Good for an initial neuron or MLP. |
| Classification | Threshold, circle versus center, parabola boundary, XOR, and neuron basics. Build a decision boundary and inspect errors. |
| Image | 500 normalized UCI 8×8 handwritten digits: 400 training and 100 held-out images, with digit IDs 0–9. This is not MNIST. |
| Token sequences | Color cycle and counting, with token IDs, position IDs, and aligned next-token targets. Used for the small transformer. |
| Attention and probabilities | Query/key/value message lookups and class scores for inspecting attention and softmax. |

The **Train / test split** selector offers the source's default split or 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, and 90% training splits. The Details panel shows how many examples each side contains.

## Import your own CSV

Choose **Custom CSV…** as a Dataset source, then select a local `.csv` file. The file remains in the browser and is included in a saved project JSON; importing the saved project does not require the original CSV. The parser supports a header row, quoted fields, at least two data rows, 2–129 columns, up to 50,000 rows, and a 10 MB file. Feature columns must be numeric. A classification target may contain text labels.

Each output handle uses its CSV column name when headers are present. Wire the target column to **Target** or directly to the target input of **Loss**. That wiring tells the app which column is the target; until then the preview uses the last column or the sole text-label column. In Details you can change **Task** between regression, binary classification, and multiclass classification, toggle **First row contains headers**, and **Replace CSV file**. Invalid feature values or an incompatible task show an error there.

For several numeric columns, connect each column to **Concatenate** with axis 1. Vectors of shape `[n]` are treated as `[n, 1]` for this operation, so four columns become `[n, 4]` without four separate reshape blocks. Other operations keep their own shape rules; see [Block reference](BLOCKS.md).

## What gets reported

The prediction input to **Loss** and its target input define the model's supervised output. **Reporting** can plot a one- or two-input prediction graph when that path is connected and valid. **Test** lists predictions for every evaluated example, reports loss, and reports class accuracy for classifiers or token accuracy for sequence tasks. For the details of training and testing, see [Training and testing](TRAINING.md).

For source attribution and reproduction of the digit data, see [CNN data](CNN-DATA.md).

## Text datasets

Choose **Text / reviews…** for review CSV, plain-text next-token data, or prepared JSON. The text importer fits a vocabulary on training documents, preserves explicit splits, and provides counts or token IDs plus positions and targets. See the [text curriculum guide](TEXT-CURRICULUM.md) for formats, limits, and real-data examples.

An optional CSV column named `split` may contain `train` or `test` for each data row. Both splits must be present. This metadata is removed from model inputs, preserved in saved projects, and takes precedence over percentage-based splitting. If students use the held-out rows to choose settings or stop training, call that partition validation and reserve a separate final test file.

For multiclass text, use `text,label,split` and select the multiclass task in the importer. For structured stories, add a `question` column and put newline-separated facts inside each quoted `text` cell. The fact representation exposes separate fact/question token tensors, fact positions, and padding masks. Vocabulary and answer classes are fitted on training examples; unknown test answer classes and overlong stories produce errors. Fixed token inputs use separate unknown and padding IDs. The inspector shows the encoded facts and question separately.

## Feature standardization

Place **Standardize features** after assembling numeric inputs and before trainable layers. Click **Fit on training rows** in its inspector. Training means and population standard deviations are saved and reused on held-out rows. Refit after changing the training split or feature construction. See [housing pilot](STANDARDIZATION-HOUSING-PILOT.md).

## Automatically detected inputs

Dataset outputs contributing to the prediction side of a Loss (or Cross entropy) block are detected as inputs, including paths through Standardize features, Arithmetic, and other operations. Dataset Details lists the connected inputs and updates when wiring changes. Unused columns and target columns are excluded. One- and two-feature visualizations use these inputs without requiring separate Input blocks; preprocessing remains part of the prediction.

## Original dataset rows in the Data tab

When a tensor row represents an example, the Data tab labels it with the original zero-based row number from Dataset rows. Split selection, mini-batching, and shuffling preserve these numbers and their order. The labels follow columns through Concatenate, Standardize, Matrix product, bias addition, and Softmax. Slicing and reshaping preserve them only when the example axis is preserved. A reduction over examples removes the labels; a per-example reduction over features keeps them. Parameters, token positions, image rows, and custom experiments without known row identities retain tensor indices or their existing semantic labels.
