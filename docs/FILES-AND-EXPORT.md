# Saving and exporting

## Keep an editable Neural Canvas project

Saved projects use the `neural-canvas-state` format name. Projects saved by the earlier Backprop Builder app still import normally; saving them again uses the new name.

Choose **File → Save** to download a project JSON file. It includes the graph, node settings and parameters, group hierarchy, current view and selection, and the recorded execution state. Choose **File → Import** to reopen it. Import also opens any [example project](../public/models/README.md). **File → New** clears the workspace; save the current project first if you want to keep it. Projects are local files rather than accounts or hosted documents.

Use **Edit → Undo**, Copy, Paste, and Duplicate while building. The app does not promise compatibility with every historical saved-project format.

## Export runnable PyTorch

**File → Export Python file** downloads `neural-canvas-model.py`. **File → Export PyTorch notebook** downloads `neural-canvas-model.ipynb`. The export turns a supported connected graph into PyTorch tensor calculations with its current parameter values. A graph must have exactly one Dataset block, complete connections, and at most one Loss block. If it cannot be translated, the app shows an export error instead of a misleading file.

Dataset rows are not embedded in the Python file or notebook. For an imported CSV, put the original CSV beside the downloaded file, keeping its filename and row order. For a built-in dataset, the app downloads `neural-canvas-dataset.json` alongside the model export. Keep both downloads in the same folder. The generated code loads the sibling dataset file before creating and running the model. In a notebook, run it with that folder as the working directory.

The generated program is a starting point for experiments outside the visual app. It includes a small training loop when the graph has a loss and emits evaluation results. The current **Train** settings carry over: batch size, reshuffling, epoch count, and reporting interval. At each report it evaluates training and held-out loss without updating parameters on the held-out examples, and plots both curves when Matplotlib is available. It is not a hosted training service or an export of the canvas layout.

If you only want the guide, choose **Neural Canvas → Reference** in the app's top bar. It opens the GitHub README in a new tab.

Imported text projects also save their vocabulary, tokenization settings, original documents, and fixed document splits. Their Python/notebook exports include `neural-canvas-dataset.json`, with prepared numerical examples and text metadata; keep it beside the export. See [Text curriculum](TEXT-CURRICULUM.md).

## Automatic local recovery

The app saves a recovery copy in this browser's IndexedDB every three seconds while editing. It includes the model and dataset, parameter values, epoch count, loss history, run controls, and shuffle preference. Tensor training saves matching parameters and metrics at each reporting checkpoint; between checkpoints, recovery returns to the last saved checkpoint. The sidebar shows the last successful local save or a storage error.

When reopening the app, choose **Restore workspace** or **Discard recovery**. The existing copy is not overwritten while this choice is pending. Restoring leaves playback and training paused; optimizer moments are not resumed. File → New replaces the recovery copy with the new workspace on the next save.

Recovery is the most recently saved workspace for this site in this browser, shared across tabs. It does not sync between devices, and clearing browser site data removes it. A crash can lose changes since the last successful save. Continue using **File → Save** for portable backups; those files also preserve epochs per run, reporting frequency, and examples per update.
